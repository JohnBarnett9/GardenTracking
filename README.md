# GardenTracking
Tracks seeds inventory, tags for every seed, tags for every type, crops, notes for every crop, for plants over a growing season.

## Introduction

The goal of Garden Tracking is to provide individuals and organizations with:
- A tool to track inventory of seeds over many years.
- Sophisticated searching of Seeds and Crops.

## Note about version control

I started developing this Application in June 2017.
A few months later I put the source code into version control of BitBucket.
This is because I wanted a private remote repo for free.
I have aproximately 390 commits in BitBucket.
Sensitive information for the Garden Tracking App is not in version control.
As I learned more about writing a Full Stack Web App, I learned
-put all database access code into a single file.
-the single file reads a config file of sensitive information.

I was not feasible or wise (from a security perspective) to copy my 390 commit history from BitBucket to GitHub, becuase sensitive information is spread out over many files.
